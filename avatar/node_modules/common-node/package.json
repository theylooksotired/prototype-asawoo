  "readme": "# Common Node\n\nThis package implements a number of [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org) \nproposals on top of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) using \n[node-fibers](https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers). Fibers are used to emulate multi-threading within a single process, allowing one to use a synchronous programming style and as a result:\n\n* write fast CRUD webapps that run on Node.js without messy callbacks and with very little overhead\n* run [webapps, middleware and libraries](https://github.com/olegp/common-node/wiki) written for [RingoJS](http://ringojs.org), [Narwhal](http://narwhaljs.org/), [Akshell](http://www.akshell.com), [Erbix](http://www.erbix.com/), [Wakanda](http://www.wakanda.org/), [v8cgi](http://code.google.com/p/v8cgi/) and [other implementations](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Implementations)\n* mix & match synchronous/asynchronous styles and use the best tool for the job by writing maintainable business logic in a synchronous manner\n* write concise, legible shell scripts\n\nFor an example of a production app using Common Node, check out [StartHQ](https://starthq.com).\n\nIf you have a spare 20 minutes, you can also check out [this presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/olegp/server-side-javascript-going-all-the-way) (audio included). \nIf you have any questions about Common Node, or [`mongo-sync`](https://github.com/olegp/mongo-sync), [`stick`](https://github.com/olegp/stick) and other libraries built on top of it, please post them to the [Common Node mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/common-node) or IRC, channel [#common-node](irc://irc.freenode.net/common-node) on Freenode. \n\nFor a real world application using Common Node, take a look at the [Minimal CMS](https://github.com/olegp/mcms).\n\nThe following modules are included:\n\n* assert - [Unit Testing/1.0](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Unit_Testing/1.0) (available in Node) & a suite for running tests\n* console - [Console](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Console) - partial implementation available in Node\n* system - [System/1.0](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/System/1.0)\n* binary - [Binary/B](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Binary/B)\n* io - [IO/A](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/IO/A), including a `ByteArray` backed `MemoryStream`\n* fs - [Filesystem/A](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Filesystem/A)\n* httpserver - [JSGI 0.3](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/JSGI/Level0/A/Draft2) compatible HTTP server\n* httpclient - [HTTP Client/A](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/HTTP_Client/A)\n* ringo/httpclient - [RingoJS HttpClient](http://ringojs.org/api/master/ringo/httpclient/) wrapper for `httpclient`\n* subprocess - methods for launching subprocesses modeled after Ringo\n* socket - [Sockets/A](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Sockets/A) (work in progress)\n\n### Installation\n\nIf you don't already have them, [install Node version 0.10.0 or later](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation) (previous versions for Node going back as far as 0.4.0 are also available in NPM) and [Node Package Manager](http://npmjs.org). It's also highly recommended that you have your $NODE_PATH variable [set correctly](https://github.com/olegp/common-node/issues/20).\n\nInstall `common-node` as a global package:\n\n\n```bash\n[sudo] npm -g install common-node\n```\n\nRun the \"Hello World\" example:\n\n\n```bash\ncommon-node $NODE_PATH/common-node/examples/hello.js\n```\n\nYou shouldn't see any output. To test that it's working, make an HTTP request from another prompt:\n\n\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:8080/\n```\n\nNote: by default the port used is 8080 - to change this add the port number you want as the last command line argument.\n\n### Examples\n\nA number of examples are available in [common-node/examples](https://github.com/olegp/common-node/tree/master/examples):\n\n  * `hello.js` - Hello World webapp using JSGI to return a simple text response\n  * `static.js` - streams a static file as a response\n  * `http.js` - makes an HTTP request to another server and returns the result in the response\n  * `sleep.js` -  sleeps for one second before returning a response\n  * `spawn.js` -  spawns a new fiber which prints to stdout ten seconds after processing a request\n  * `twitter.js` - an example of using Twitter's streaming API, uses HttpClient & TextStream for reading one line at a time\n  * `chat.js` - Telnet chat server, compare this to an [async implementation](http://pastebin.com/Rhbbr6Tf)\n\nFor more usage examples, please refer to the tests in the  [common-node/test](https://github.com/olegp/common-node/tree/master/test) directory.\n\nIf you're looking for an Express like framework that works with Common Node, take a look at [Stick](https://github.com/olegp/stick/). There's also the [Notes example webapp](https://github.com/olegp/notes) which uses Stick and a MongoDB data store.\n\nCommon Node also works well with [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), check out [this example](https://gist.github.com/1447709).\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe API reference is available at <http://olegp.github.com/common-node/doc/>\n\nTo generate the documentation, install RingoJS and run:\n\n\n```bash\nringo-doc -n \"Common Node\" -s ./lib -d ./doc --file-urls\n```\n\n### Tests\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/olegp/common-node.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/olegp/common-node)\n\nTo run the unit tests run:\n\n\n```bash\nnode test/all.js\n```\n\nYou can also run individual tests or sets of tests, for example:\n\n\n```bash\nnode test/io.js\nnode test/fs-base/all.js\n```\n\n### Benchmarks\n\nAlthough `common-node` is optimized for development efficiency rather than performance, \na number of benchmarks are included in [common-node/benchmarks](https://github.com/olegp/common-node/tree/master/benchmarks). \nA `common-node` version, an asynchronous Node version using Connect & a RingoJS version of each benchmark is provided. \nThe scripts are based on the [Ringo/Node benchmark scripts](https://github.com/hns/ringo-node-benchmark), with a couple of additions.\n\nThe benchmarks have the following dependencies:\n\n  * `connect` for Node which can be installed via npm\n  * `ringo` which can be installed by following the instructions in the [RingoJS repository](https://github.com/ringo/ringojs)\n  * `ab` - installed with `sudo apt-get install apache2-utils` on Debian/Ubuntu\n  * `gnuplot` - installed with `sudo apt-get install gnuplot-nox`\n  \nTo run them and generate graphs, execute the following command:\n\n\n```bash\ncd benchmarks/; ./run; ./graph\n```\n\nThis will generate PNG images of the graphs in `benchmarks/results/graphs/`. Some results are provided below: \n\n  * [buffer-alloc](http://olegp.github.com/common-node/graphs/buffer-alloc.png) - creates a number of byte arrays per request; the difference in performance compared to Node is due to the [array being cleared](https://github.com/olegp/common-node/issues/6)\n  * [hello-world](http://olegp.github.com/common-node/graphs/hello-world.png) - returns a dynamically generated string\n  * [no-alloc](http://olegp.github.com/common-node/graphs/no-alloc.png)\n  * [parse-json](http://olegp.github.com/common-node/graphs/parse-json.png) \n  * [set-timeout](http://olegp.github.com/common-node/graphs/set-timeout.png) - sleep for 100ms before returning a response\n  * [static-file](http://olegp.github.com/common-node/graphs/static-file.png) - returns a file served from the file system\n  * [string-alloc](http://olegp.github.com/common-node/graphs/string-alloc.png)\n\nAs you can see from the results and given no profiling or optimization work has been done so far, there's room for improvement. \nAny patches or suggestions on how to improve performance would be greatly appreciated.\n\n### Embedding\n\nYou can use Common Node without invoking the `common-node` binary. There are two ways to do this:\n\n  * the bootstrapped approach allows you to run your Common Node code as is, but prevents you from accessing core Node modules such as `fs` (by over-riding that with Common Node's `fs` module instead)\n  * the mixed mode approach allows you to use Commo Node along side your existing Node specific code\n\n#### Bootstrapped\n\nTo bootstrap Common Node & assuming your app's entry point is in `main.js`, simply add an `index.js` with the following contents to the same directory:\n\n\n```js\nrequire('common-node').run('./main');\n```\n\nThen, instead of starting your app with `common-node main.js`, run `node index.js`.\n\n#### Mixed Mode\n\nTo use Common Node alongside your existing Node code, you will need to:\n\n  * run your app with `node` instead of `common-node`\n  * change the way in which you require modules from `var io = require('io');` to `var io = require('common-node').io;` or update your NODE_PATH to include `common-node/lib` (see `bin/common-node` for an example)\n  * make sure any synchronous code is inside a fiber that has been created with `spawn` (in the example below each call of exports.app runs in a new fiber)\n\nFor example the following modified version of `examples/http.js` can be run directly via `node http.js`\n\n\n```js\nvar HttpClient = require('common-node').httpclient.HttpClient;\n\nexports.app = function(request) {\n  return {\n    status: 200,\n    headers: {},\n    body: new HttpClient({\n      url: 'http://google.com'\n    }).finish().body\n  };\n};\n\nif (require.main == module) {\n  require('common-node').run(exports);\n}\n```\n\n### Contributing\n\nTo contribute to this project, you can start by trying to run the tests on your system and posting any failures on the issue tracker. It is advised that you use the version in master for doing this, which you can install via:\n\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g https://github.com/olegp/common-node/tarball/master\n```\n\nIf you run into any issues along the way, whether related to using this library\nin your own project or to the documentation, please post your comments on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/olegp/common-node/issues/). The tracker is also a great place to contribute ideas and find out what needs doing.\n\nIf you're coming from Ringo or Narwhal, please try running the tests for some of your existing packages. If the tests pass and the package is compatible with Common Node, feel free to add it to the [wiki](https://github.com/olegp/common-node/wiki).\n\nTo find specific issues not listed on the tracker, you can run the following command from inside the `common-node` directory.\n\n\n```bash\ngrep 'TODO' lib/*\n```\n\nTo contribute code: fork the project, make and commit your changes and send a pull request.\n\nA number of higher level goals, such as descriptions of packages that would complement Common Node are listed on the [TODO wiki page](https://github.com/olegp/common-node/wiki/TODO).\n\n### Maintainers\n\n  * [Alex Lam](http://github.com/alexlamsl)\n  * [Oleg Podsechin](http://github.com/olegp)\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n  * Marcel Laverdet for [node-fibers](https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers)\n  * Hannes Wallnoefer and others from [RingoJS](http://ringojs.org) - this project uses a number of its tests & the Ringo code was used as a starting point for some modules\n  * Kris Kowal, Tom Robinson, Isaac Schlueter for [Narwhal](http://narwhaljs.org/) - this project used a number of its modules as a starting point and some methods in e.g. Binary have been copied as is\n  * everybody on the [CommonJS](http://groups.google.com/group/commonjs) mailing list\n\n### License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011+ Oleg Podsechin\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n",
